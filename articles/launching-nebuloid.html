<h1>
	Luanching Nebuloid
</h1>

<p>
	For my entire existence as a junior software engineer, I didn't have a website!
	In the back of my mind, it was always nagging at me&hellip;
</p>

<ol class="conversation">
	<li>
		<b>
			Me
		</b>
		<p>
			Nolan, why not build a website?
			Nolan, it'll show recruiters you mean business.
			Nolan, your website though!
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>
			Also me
		</b>
		<p>
			Yeah, yeah, inner me&hellip;I get the idea!
			Shush now, I'll make my website.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>
			Me again
		</b>
		<p>
			Okie :)
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	&hellip;Yeah, my inner monologue happened pretty much just like that.
	Except, it took place over the course of *a few years*, while in school and on my first full-time job.
</p>

<p>
	I feel like this is a relatable experience to any junior web developer without a personal website.
	Take it from me: not having a website doesn't make you a worse developer, but it also doesn't advocate for your abilities either.
	That said, I'm quite proud to introduce my developer blog & portfolio, ***Nebuloid***.
</p>

<h2>
	Why *Nebuloid*?
</h2>

<p>
	I wanted a website that had a space-themed domain name.
	Unfortunately, many of the good ones were taken.
	At some point I settled on a made-up word.
	Since it was (relatively) unused, I felt I could claim it as my own.
	&hellip;although, my domain now shares the namesake of an obscure item from Animal Crossing.
</p>

<p>
	After adopting the name, it became a little bit more personal to me than just this.
	We all have a multitude of conjoined and conflicting parts that make up our collective selves.
	*Nebuloid* became an abstract manifestation of a part of me!
</p>

<p>
	&hellip;Hmm, perhaps more aptly: *Nebuloid* is just a techy developer brand of mine.
	ðŸ˜‰
</p>

<h2>
	Technologies
</h2>

<p>
	I wanted to be the owner of the website from the rock-bottom to the tippy-top of the whole stack.
	I created a Backend API and a Frontend website for it, set up a Linux Server and a DB Cluster, using all of these technologies:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		TypeScript
	</li>

	<li>
		ESLint
	</li>

	<li>
		NodeJS
	</li>

	<li>
		ExpressJS
	</li>

	<li>
		GraphQL
	</li>

	<li>
		Mongoose
	</li>

	<li>
		MongoDB
	</li>

	<li>Linux
		Server
	</li>

	<li>
		SSH
	</li>

	<li>
		NGINX
	</li>

	<li>
		PM2
	</li>

	<li>
		NextJS
	</li>

	<li>
		ReactJS
	</li>

	<li>
		SASS
	</li>

	<li>
		Figma
	</li>

	<li>
		StoryBook
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Lovingly, I collectively call this the GREMLiN Stack
	(GraphQL, React, Express, Linux, Node).
	Okay, that's a made up acronym, but it sounds pretty good right?.
</p>

<p>
	Creating something like this, and owning it throughout the stack, really helped me grasp a whole onslaught of topics.
	I hadn't had much experience with Figma or with Server Administration, for example.
</p>

<p>
	As a Full-Stack developer, I believe its important to understand the entirety of a project's stack on some level.
	While people are right to declare a niche of their work as a highlighted expertise, at times its just as important to understand the connecting areas of a system.
	And while I maintain this philosophy, I also just think its fun to see everything connect smoothly and seamlessly.
	That, my friends, is why I am a Full-Stack engineer.
