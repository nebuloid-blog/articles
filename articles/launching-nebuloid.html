<h1>
	Luanching Nebuloid
</h1>

<p>
	Hello all! Welcome to the my first blog post on <strong>Nebuloid</strong>.
	I believe that every developer worth their salt can benefit from having a personal website!
	But, that is not to say that an absence of a website makes a developer any worse at what they do&hellip;
	Rather, it's simply about advocating for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	A close friend of mine once asked me: <q>if you don't advocate for yourself, who will?</q>
	If you don't narrorate your story, someone else will do it for you &mdash; and it might not be the story you wish to tell.
</p>

<p>
	I feel like this is a relatable experience to any web developer.
	That said, I'm quite proud to introduce my developer blog & portfolio, <strong>Nebuloid</strong>.
</p>

<h2>
	Why <em>Nebuloid</em>?
</h2>

<p>
	The website's name may seem strange to you.
	Why give it a name like <em>Nebuloid</em>?
	Why give it a name at all?
</p>

<p>
	Well, I wanted to introduce whimsy to my professional appearance &mdash; it is a manifestation of who I am.
	I believe that, without whimsy, without a little humor or personality,
		we can lose ourselves and our work in society's identity of corporate culture.
	We lose the ability to remain creative, aspirational, driven, passionate&hellip;
	So, inversely, to bring our authentic selves to work, we are giving it our all and are
		in the mindset to truly impact the future of a product.
</p>

<h2>
	Technologies
</h2>

<p>
	That's the philosophy of the site, but what about the technologies that power it?
	When I set out to build this website, I wanted to be the owner of the website, from the rock-bottom to the tippy-top of the stack.
	I created a Backend API and a Frontend website for it, set up a Linux Server and a DB Cluster, using all of these technologies:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		TypeScript
	</li>

	<li>
		ESLint
	</li>

	<li>
		NodeJS
	</li>

	<li>
		ExpressJS
	</li>

	<li>
		GraphQL
	</li>

	<li>
		Mongoose
	</li>

	<li>
		MongoDB
	</li>

	<li>
		Linux Server (Ubuntu)
	</li>

	<li>
		SSH
	</li>

	<li>
		NGINX
	</li>

	<li>
		PM2
	</li>

	<li>
		NextJS
	</li>

	<li>
		ReactJS
	</li>

	<li>
		SASS
	</li>

	<li>
		Figma
	</li>

	<li>
		StoryBook
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Lovingly, I collectively call this the <abbr title="GraphQL, React, Express, Linux, Node">GREMLiN</abbr> Stack.
	Okay, that's a made up acronym, but it sounds pretty good, right?
</p>

<p>
	Creating something like this, and owning it throughout the stack, really helped me grasp a whole onslaught of topics.
	I hadn't had much experience with Figma or with Server Administration, for example.
</p>

<p>
	As a Full-Stack developer, I believe its important to understand the entirety of a project's stack on <em>some</em> level.
	While people are right to declare a niche of their work as a highlighted expertise, at times its just as important to understand the connecting areas of a system.
	And while I maintain this philosophy, I also just think its fun to see everything connect smoothly and seamlessly.
	That, my friends, is why I am a Full-Stack engineer, and not specifically a Frontend or Backend engineer.
