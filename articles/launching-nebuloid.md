# Launching Nebuloid
For my entire existence as a junior software engineer, I didn't have a website!
In the back of my mind, it was always nagging at me...

**Me:** *"Nolan, why not build a website? Nolan, it'll show recruiters you mean business. Nolan, your website though!"*
**Also Me:** *"Yeah, yeah, inner me...I get the idea! Shush now, I'll make my website.*
**Me Again:** *Okie :)*

...Yeah, my inner monologue happened pretty much just like that.
Except, it took place over the course of *a few years*, while in school and on my first full-time job.

I feel like this is a relatable experience to any junior web developer without a personal website.
Take it from me: not having a website doesn't make you a worse developer, but it also doesn't advocate for your abilities either.
That said, I'm quite proud to introduce my developer blog & portfolio, ***Nebuloid***.

## Why *Nebuloid*?
I wanted a website that had a space-themed domain name.
Unfortunately, many of the good ones were taken.
At some point I settled on a made-up word.
Since it was (relatively) unused, I felt I could claim it as my own.
...although, my domain now shares the namesake of an obscure item from Animal Crossing.

After adopting the name, it became a little bit more personal to me than just this.
We all have a multitude of conjoined and conflicting parts that make up our collective selves.
*Nebuloid* became an abstract manifestation of a part of me!

...Hmm, perhaps more aptly: *Nebuloid* is just a techy developer brand of mine.

## Technologies
I wanted to be the owner of the website from the rock-bottom to the tippy-top of the whole stack.
I created a Backend API and a Frontend website for it, set up a Linux Server and a DB Cluster, using all of these technologies:
- TypeScript
- ESLint
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- GraphQL
- Mongoose
- MongoDB
- Linux Server
- SSH
- NGINX
- PM2
- NextJS
- ReactJS
- SASS
- Figma
- StoryBook

Lovingly, I collectively call this the GREMLiN Stack.
(GraphQL, React, Express, Linux, Node).
Okay, that's a made up acronym, but it sounds pretty good right?.


Creating something like this, and owning it throughout the stack, really helped me grasp a whole onslaught of topics.
I hadn't had much experience with Figma or with Server Administration, for example.

As a Full-Stack developer, I believe its important to understand the entirety of a project's stack on some level.
While people are right to declare a niche of their work as a highlighted expertise, at times its just as important (if not more important) to understand the connecting areas of a system.
While I maintain this philosophy, I also just think its fun to see everything connect smoothly and seamlessly.
And that, my friends, is why I am a Full-Stack engineer.
