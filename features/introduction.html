<h1>
	Hello, world!
</h1>

<p>
	Hi there! Welcome to Nebuloid.

	My name is <strong>Nolan Kovacik</strong>, and this is my corner of the internet.

	I built this site from the ground up.

	Here, you will find my professional portfolio, plus a collection of blog posts that I have written.
</p>

<h2>
	About Nolan
</h2>

<p>
	I am a Full-Stack Engineer, a seasoned Game Master, and a lover of corgis.

	I spend my time programming, playing games, hiking, and volunteering.
	While I am absolutely a textbook introvert,
		I love to get closely involved with the people and causes that I believe in.
</p>

<h2>
	Work Experience
</h2>

<p>
	Most recently, I've been focused on making the engineering pipeline more equitable.

	In 2022, I've volunteered to teach highschool coding classes through Microsoft TEALS,
		and have been helping <em>ByteBoard</em>'s company vision since then.
	I am currently a ByteBoard Assessment Grader, whose resposnsibilities
		involve evaluating various skills of software engineering candidates for hire.
</p>

<p>
	Prior to this, I've been mentored by some great talent in the field.
</p>

<p>
	I worked as a Full-Stack React Native Engineer at a small startup called Regroup, until 2022.

	The company aimed to create a space to host online and in-person events, even amidst the pandemic.

	While there, I worked closesly with the Founder,
		<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/edjiang/'>Edward Jiang</a>,
		an Ex-Senior Software Engineer from Uber.
</p>

<p>
	During my time at CodeDay Labs, I spearheaded a ReactJS project under the talent and guidance of
		<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarlandie/'>Thomas Serlandie</a>.

	Thomas founded the company <em>ChartedSails</em>, and is now the CTO at <em>Memfault</em>.
