<h1>
	Hello, world!
</h1>

<p>
	Hi there! Welcome to Nebuloid.

	My name is <b>Nolan Kovacik</b>, and this is my corner of the internet.

	I built this site from the ground up.

	Here, you will find my professional portfolio, and
	a collection of blog posts that I have written.

<h2>
	About Nolan
</h2>

<p>
	I am a Full-Stack Engineer, a Professional Game Master, and a lover of corgis.

	I spend most of my time programming,
	but always find time to play games and walk
	the dogs with my partner,
	<a href='https://francescoronel.com/'>Frances Coronel</a>.
</p>

<h2>
	Work Experience
</h2>

<p>
	Most recently, I've been focused on making the
	engineering pipeline more equitable.

	I've volunteered to teach highschool coding
	classes through Microsoft TEALS,
	and have been helping ByteBoard in their mission
	by grading their candidate assessments part-time.
</p>

<p>
	Prior to this, I've been mentored by some great talent in the field.
</p>

<p>
	I worked as a Full-Stack React Native Engineer at
	a small startup called Regroup.

	The company aimed to create a space to host
	smaller online and in-person events, even amidst
	the pandemic.

	While there, I worked closesly with the Founder,
	<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/edjiang/'>Edward Jiang</a>,
	an Ex-Senior Software Engineer from Uber.
</p>

<p>
	During my time at CodeDay Labs, I spearheaded a ReactJS project under the
	guidance of and talent of
	<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarlandie/'>Thomas Serlandie</a>.

	Thomas was the Director of Software Engineering at Fitbit,
	and is now the Founder of his own company, ChartedSails.
